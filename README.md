### What this app exhibits

In this tracker app, users can select, drag and see updating natural events around the world, such as wildfire, volcano eruptions and tropical storms. These events are exhibited according to their positions.

Some events do not occur during the observatory period. Therefore, under each category, the counter shows if and how many events were documnented during this period.
